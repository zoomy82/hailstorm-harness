## Hailstorm-Harness
The Hailstorm-Harness Framework is a powerful tool for building safe, compliant, and efficient agent-based systems. Its comprehensive protections and flexible configurations make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from AI development to logistics optimization. Its built on top of the [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) Library. 
The framework is designed to enhance agent-based simulations with advanced protections. It integrates features like hallucinations protection, misuse prevention, privacy safeguards, policy adherence, and more. By enabling robust configurations through a JSON file, the framework ensures agents operate safely, efficiently, and within defined ethical and operational boundaries.

## Background

Agent-based simulations are widely used in AI, robotics, and operational research. However, traditional frameworks lack comprehensive safeguards against issues like hallucinations, policy violations, or misuse. This gap motivated the development of Hailstorm-Harness.

## Objectives
•	Enhance agent behavior safety and compliance.
•	Provide customizable protections for various use cases.
•	Enable efficient resource management and scalability.

## Features
In addition to all of the features that LangGraph has Hailstorm-Harness also includes the following: 
1. Hallucinations Protection: Limits nonsensical outputs.
2. Misuse Prevention: Prevents malicious use of agents.
3. Privacy Protection: Masks sensitive information.
4. Policy Adherence: Enforces compliance with defined policies.
5. Toxicity Protection: Prevents toxic outputs.
6. Feedback Loops: Supports iterative improvement of agents.
7. Grounded Controls: Avoids responses without evidence.
8. Response Relevancy: Ensures agents stay on topic.
9. Loop Controls: Prevents infinite or unnecessary loops.
10. RBAC Controls: Role-based access for agent actions.
11. Token Limits: Manages resource constraints for agents.
12. Long-Term Memory: Enables agents to retain and use contextual information.
13. Resiliency: Adds fallback mechanisms to handle failures.

## Architecture
The way we designed this framework was to have these processes and controls before prompts get sent to an agent and after the agent sends its response. By sitting before and after the agent execution this provides a secure means of agent actions and functions. 

prompt.                              Allowed                                response                              validated allowed



With each and every prompt/text/token going to the agent there are a number of controls and secure mechanisms that validate the input to make sure things align with the policies that have been established.

Then once the Agent has generated its response and before it gets sent to either the end user or another agent Hailstorm once again does a final check on the response to check for things such as hallucinations, toxicity checks, RBAC controls, grounded responses and a few other checks. If all these checks pass then the response is allowed on through. If not things will get rejected and an exception will occur or a Denial of the generated response to the end user.

With this kind of controls before anything is sent to an agent and also after the response is generated will ensure that all actions and responses from the agent has been vetted and nothing unusual happens. With these types of controls in place it also protects from jailbrakes, hacker attests and prompt injection tricks. 

## Benefits
Enhanced Safety and Compliance
• Protects against harmful, irrelevant, or unsafe agent actions.
• Safeguards sensitive information with privacy controls.

Flexibility and Customization
• Modular protections allow users to enable only the features they need.
• Configurable via a simple JSON file.

Scalability and Performance
• Efficient resource management with token limits and resiliency mechanisms.
• Supports long-term memory for context-aware simulations.

Open-Source Accessibility
• MIIT License encourages community contributions and widespread adoption.

This project was created as a submission for the LLM Agents, MOOC Hackathon and its our hope that it helps the LLM community.
